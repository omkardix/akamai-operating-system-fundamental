History of Linux
The Linux operating system is a complete, open source operating system that combines the GNU utilities and the Linux kernel. The kernel is the central core of the Linux operating system. It manages all the computerâ€™s physical devices. The term kernel is generally used to describe the main part of any operating system.

The Linux kernel was developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991, while he was a student at the University of Helsinki. He developed a UNIX-like operating system kernel for his own use. He posted his creation on the Internet and asked other programmers to help him further develop it. Until Torvalds agreed to release Linux under GPL, the GNU project was not a complete operating system. And the kernel itself was incomplete as an operating system without utilities. 

Over the past few years, Linux has rapidly gained ground in the competitive operating system marketplace. For example, Linux is now widely preferred for web servers and Internet systems. Many individuals and organizations have accepted it as a desktop and server alternative because of its high security, low cost, and ease of licensing. 

Linux is used on servers, workstations, and desktops. Servers are computers optimized for supplying services to other computers. Workstations are computers optimized for use by business users. Desktops are used primarily by home users and small businesses.
